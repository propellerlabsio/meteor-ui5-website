# Roadmap

## Model

### Next up
1. Add filter support
1. Add sorter support
1. List binding to array properties of single documents

### Planned
1. Add support for two-way binding (requires allow write to collections - not Meteor best practice which is update via method).
2. Add TreeBinding model (I think that controls that can use this might be deprecated - check first.)

## Demo

### Next up
1. Remove debugging version in UI5 bootstrap and/or make our code work with debugging on / off.

### Planned
1. Add comprehensive demo app that showcases many features of UI5 and shows source code for how to do it.
1. Build tutorial around ToDo's - seems to be industry standard simple demo/tutorial app.
