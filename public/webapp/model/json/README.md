# Flat JSON Model
## Purpose
This is an amalagmated copy of the standard SAP classes for JSONModels and ClientModels.  It serves two purposes:
1. Make it easier to debug the JSON model to see how everything works
2. Serve as the basis for the new Meteor Model code
It is not intended that the code in this folder be kept longer term or ever distributed.
